				<h2>❀ Yvette Ishihara ❀</h2>
				<h3>The Founder of Whithered Flower Shop</h3>
				<p>Yvette was born on April 27, 1995. During her college days, she worked as a florist
				at a flower shop near her school for 2 years and decided to resign to focus on her studies.
				She is taking BS in Entrepreneurship and when she graduated, she decided to establish a flower shop.
				Yvettte likes the scent of the flowers that's why she decided to establish it. She named it Withered
				because she believe that just like flowers, our life will wither away however our life will bloom again
				when the right time has come</p>
